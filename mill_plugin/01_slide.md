# The Plugin #

So we wrote a Rails plugin to do exactly that.  The plugin consists of 5 parts.

# Parts #

* <code>acts_as millennium</code>: this is an ActiveRecord plugin that marks model objects that resides in the existing database.
* <code>acts_as_millsyncable</code>: - acts_as_local: the complement of the above.
* <code>field_pair</code>: represents the relationship between fields in the two databases.  Also encodes the relatioonship between the fields.
* synchronization tables: we keep track of differences between the databases 
  and their results.
* the synchronizer

There was an extra requirement: all changes needed to be confirmed by an administrative user.  As a reault all differences between the two databases need to themselves be recorded in a database.  Since we'd already established that modifications to the legacy database are forbidden, these would need to go in our local database until an admin could approve them.  Honestly this requirement was probably a blessing in disguise, because otherwise we might not have separated the process of scanning for differences from resolving them as early as we did.  

Key to the process of synchronizing records is first scanning them for differences.  Actually scanning entire tables at once is feasible but impractical: the scan of a single table can take more than an hour, which lead to treating scans as if they were made of unicorn poop.  

Database scans are not made of unicorn poop.  They just aren't.  

The key to letting scans be lightweight is to keep track of where we are at any point so that we can pick right back up when we get interupted.
